My name is **Sang woo Ham**. I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA.

My goal is to be **a responsible, polymathic, and a practical engineer**. The completion of tasks under trust and pursuing sustainability for the Earth are my top responsibility/priority. Learning/applying new things give me what to do when I confront challenges. Based on the responsibility and experience, I would like to bring the research into real world practice by connecting multiple stakeholders such as researchers, engineers, developers, etc.

I am interested in **Building energy analysis/modeling by using R/Python through various Probabilistic models with Pyro/Stan/Pymc3 and physics-informed black-box models.**. 

My current research is providing a scalable MPC software for small and medium commercial buildings. This work includes: (1) improved system identification, (2) hybrid modeling approach for unmeasured disturbacne prediction, and (3) integrated open-source software development.
